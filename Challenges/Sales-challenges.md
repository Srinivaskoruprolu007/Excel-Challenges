### **Dataset: Sales Transactions**  
Use the provided dataset to answer the following questions and practice essential Excel functions and features.

---

1. **Basic Formula**:  
   Calculate the total sales for each salesperson using the formula: `Units Sold * Unit Price`. Create a new column called **Total Sales** for this.

2. **SUM Function**:  
   What is the total sales value across all salespersons? Use the **SUM** function to find this.

3. **AVERAGE Function**:  
   Find the average number of units sold across all salespersons using the **AVERAGE** function.

4. **Conditional Formatting**:  
   Apply conditional formatting to highlight all sales transactions where the **Total Sales** exceed $60,000.

5. **COUNTIF Function**:  
   How many salespersons sold more than **50 units** in any transaction? Use **COUNTIF** to find this.

6. **Data Validation**:  
   Add data validation to the **Region** column by creating a dropdown list of the regions to make data entry easier.

7. **Pivot Table**:  
   Create a Pivot Table that summarizes **total sales by product** and **region**. Use this to analyze how each product performs in different regions.

8. **IF Function**:  
   Add a column to determine if each salesperson's **Total Sales** exceeded $50,000. Use the **IF** function to label transactions as either "Exceeded" or "Not Exceeded."

9. **VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP**:  
   Using a target of $45,000, create a formula that uses **VLOOKUP** or **XLOOKUP** to return "Above Target" or "Below Target" based on the **Total Sales**.

10. **SUMIFS Function**:  
    Calculate the total sales for all "Tablets" in the "West" region using the **SUMIFS** function.

11. **COUNTIFS Function**:  
    How many transactions involved selling **Laptops** in the **North** region? Use **COUNTIFS** to calculate this.

12. **Chart Creation**:  
    Create a bar chart that compares the **total sales by product**. Ensure each product is represented with its total sales value.

13. **Filter**:  
    Apply a filter to the dataset so that only **Smartphone** sales are visible. Analyze the data for this product only.

14. **Sorting**:  
    Sort the dataset by **Total Sales** in descending order to see which transactions had the highest value.

15. **Date Formatting**:  
    Reformat the **Date** column to display dates in the format **"MMM-YYYY"** (e.g., Jan-2023). This helps with a cleaner presentation.
